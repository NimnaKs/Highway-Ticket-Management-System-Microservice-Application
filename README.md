## Overview

The Highway Ticket Management System is built to handle ticketing operations for highways. The system is composed of multiple microservices that interact with each other to perform various operations such as ticket generation, validation, and status updates.

## Features

- **Microservice Architecture**: Modular design with services for ticket management, user management, and payment processing.
- **Spring Boot**: Leveraging Spring Boot for rapid development and ease of use.
- **RestTemplate**: For handling inter-service communication.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful handling of exceptions and errors.

## Architecture

The application follows a microservice architecture. Each microservice is designed to handle a specific set of responsibilities and communicates with other services through REST APIs.

### Services

- **Ticket Service**: Manages ticket creation, validation, and updates.
- **User Service**: Handles user information and authentication.
- **Payment Service**: Processes payments for the tickets.
- **Vehicle Service**: Mnage Vehicle Registration,updates and retrives.

- Maven
- Docker (optional, for containerization)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/NimnaKs/Highway-Ticket-Management-System-Microservice-Application.git
   cd Highway-Ticket-Management-System-Microservice-Application
   ```

2. **Build the project**
